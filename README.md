# Secret_Auction

Description
The Bidding System is a simple Python program that allows users to participate in an auction by entering their names and bid amounts. 
After all bids are collected, the program determines the highest bidder and displays the winner's name along with their winning bid amount.

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Run the Python script.
The program will display a logo and start collecting bids.
Enter your name when prompted.
Enter your bid amount (in the specified currency, e.g., "R" for Rand) when prompted.
You can continue to add more bidders by typing 'yes' when asked, or type 'no' to finish the bidding process.
Once you've finished entering all the bids, the program will determine the highest bidder and display the winner's name along with their winning bid amount.
